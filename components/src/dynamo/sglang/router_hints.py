"""Router-hint capability advertisement for the SGLang backend.

Mirrors ``dynamo/vllm/router_hints.py``: a worker must advertise the
``router_hint`` runtime capability plus a per-DP-rank map of KV source control
endpoints, or the router treats it as hint-incapable and silently emits no
hints.

The only difference from the vLLM version is where the endpoints come from.
vLLM reads ``kv_transfer_config.kv_connector_extra_config.secondary_tiers[]``;
SGLang has no secondary tiers, so the equivalent values live in the KVCC
HiCache storage backend's extra-config JSON
(``--hicache-storage-backend-extra-config``), whose ``control_host`` /
``control_port`` / ``control_advertise_host`` fields are what the KVCC store
binds its ZMQ peer control channel to.

    """How many KVCC control ports one attention-DP rank of this engine owns.

    Unlike vLLM, where the KV secondary tier lives in the one scheduler process
    per DP rank, SGLang builds a HiCache storage backend in *every* attention
    rank's scheduler process. All of them read the same configured base port and
    offset it by their own rank coordinate, so a DP rank occupies a whole block
    of ports rather than a single one, and the next DP rank starts after that
    block.

    The block size is the number of schedulers per DP rank, which SGLang spells
    as ``attn_cp_size * attn_tp_size`` and which reduces to ``tp_size //
    dp_size`` (``attn_tp_size = tp_size // dp_size // attn_cp_size``). Without
    attention DP there is a single DP group and the stride is unused, but 1 is
    also the honest answer: the whole engine is one block.

    Must stay in step with ``_rank_port_offset`` in SGLang's
    ``mem_cache/storage/kvcc/kvcc_store.py``; a mismatch does not fail, it makes
    peers dial the wrong rank and silently fetch the wrong attention shard.
